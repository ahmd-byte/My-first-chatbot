Details:
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs, called alveoli, may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.


Here's a more detailed breakdown:


What is Pneumonia?

Inflammation of the Lungs: It's primarily an inflammation of the lung tissue, specifically the tiny air sacs (alveoli) where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged.
Fluid/Pus Buildup: When you have pneumonia, these air sacs become inflamed and can fill with fluid, pus, and cellular debris, making it harder for oxygen to reach your bloodstream.
Severity: Pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening. It's most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with weakened immune systems or chronic health conditions.

Causes

Pneumonia can be caused by various infectious agents and, less commonly, by non-infectious factors:


Bacteria: This is the most common cause of pneumonia in adults.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus): The most frequent bacterial cause.
Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (often causes "walking pneumonia," a milder form).

Viruses: Viruses are a common cause of pneumonia in young children.

Influenza (flu) virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses (common cold), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) can all lead to pneumonia.

Fungi: More common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large amounts of fungal spores from the environment.
Other Causes (Non-infectious):

Aspiration Pneumonia: Occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit, or saliva into your lungs. This is more common in people with swallowing difficulties or those who are sedated.
Chemical Pneumonia: Caused by inhaling toxic fumes or chemicals.


Risk Factors

Certain factors can increase your risk of developing pneumonia:


Age: Children 2 years old or younger, and people 65 years old or older.
Weakened Immune System: Due to HIV/AIDS, organ transplant, chemotherapy, or long-term steroid use.
Chronic Medical Conditions: Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease.
Smoking: Damages your lungs' natural defenses against germs.
Hospitalization: Especially if you're in an intensive care unit (ICU) or on a ventilator (ventilator-associated pneumonia).
Difficulty Swallowing: Conditions like stroke, Parkinson's disease, or other neurological disorders can increase the risk of aspiration.

Symptoms

Symptoms can vary from mild to severe, depending on the type of germ causing the infection, your age, and your overall health. Common symptoms include:


Cough: May produce phlegm (mucus) that is green, yellow, or bloody.
Fever: Often accompanied by sweating and chills.
Shortness of Breath: Especially during activity.
Chest Pain: Worsens when you breathe deeply or cough.
Fatigue: Feeling very tired.
Nausea, Vomiting, or Diarrhea.
Confusion or Changes in Mental Awareness: Especially in older adults.
Bluish Lips or Fingernails: In severe cases, indicating low oxygen levels.

Diagnosis

Your doctor will typically diagnose pneumonia based on:


Physical Exam: Listening to your lungs with a stethoscope for crackling, bubbling, or wheezing sounds.
Chest X-ray: This is the most common diagnostic tool, showing inflammation or fluid in the lungs.
Blood Tests: To confirm an infection and try to identify the type of germ.
Sputum Culture: A sample of mucus coughed up from your lungs can be analyzed to identify the cause of the infection.
Pulse Oximetry: Measures the oxygen level in your blood.
Bronchoscopy: (Rarely) A procedure where a thin, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into your airways to look at your lungs and collect samples.

Treatment

Treatment depends on the type of pneumonia, its severity, and your overall health.


Antibiotics: For bacterial pneumonia. It's crucial to finish the entire course of medication, even if you start feeling better.
Antiviral Medications: For some viral pneumonias (e.g., influenza).
Antifungal Medications: For fungal pneumonia.
Supportive Care:

Rest: Get plenty of rest to help your body fight the infection.
Fluids: Drink plenty of fluids to help loosen mucus.
Over-the-counter medications: Pain relievers and fever reducers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) can help with symptoms.
Cough medicine: Use with caution, as coughing helps clear your lungs. Your doctor might recommend it if your cough is severe and prevents rest.
Oxygen Therapy: If your oxygen levels are low, you may need supplemental oxygen.
Hospitalization: Severe cases, especially in high-risk individuals, may require hospital care for IV fluids, antibiotics, and oxygen.


Prevention

You can take steps to prevent pneumonia:


Vaccinations:

Flu Vaccine: Get an annual flu shot, as influenza can often lead to pneumonia.
Pneumococcal Vaccines: Two types of vaccines (PCV13 and PPSV23) help protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Your doctor can advise which one is right for you based on age and risk factors.
COVID-19 Vaccine: Helps prevent severe illness, including pneumonia, from SARS-CoV-2.

Good Hygiene: Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Don't Smoke: Smoking damages your lungs' ability to fight off infections.
Manage Chronic Conditions: Keep conditions like asthma, diabetes, and heart disease well-controlled.
Healthy Lifestyle: Eat a balanced diet, get regular exercise, and get enough sleep to support your immune system.
